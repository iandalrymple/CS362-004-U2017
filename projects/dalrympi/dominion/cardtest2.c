// Desc: 			Unit test for fadventurer function in dominion.c
// Author: 			Ian Dalrymple
// Date Created: 	07/08/2017
// Requirements
// 1 - treasure in hand increased by 2 
// 2 - adventurer is kept in hand 
// 3 - cards drawn that are not treasure sent to discard pile 
// 4 - other players not mutated 
// 5 - other attributes beyond deck, hand, discard played are not mutated
