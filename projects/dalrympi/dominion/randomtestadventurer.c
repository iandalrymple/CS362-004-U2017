// Desc: 			Random test for fAdventurer function in dominion.c
// Author: 			Ian Dalrymple
// Date Created: 	07/21/2017
// Card Requirements:
// 1 - treasure in hand increased by 2 
// 2 - adventurer is kept in hand 
// 3 - cards drawn that are not treasure sent to discard pile deltaDisCard = dDrawn - 2
// 4 - other players not mutated 
// 5 - other attributes beyond deck, hand, discard played are not mutated
