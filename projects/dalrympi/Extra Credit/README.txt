In the Executable folder there is an exe file. It expects to be launched from 
windows command line like this:

extracredit "PATH TO TEXT FILE"

Example:

extracredit "C:\users\idalrymple\desktop\results.txt"

The results of the testing will be logged to the file defined in 
the command line. 

All the source code is in the project files.
