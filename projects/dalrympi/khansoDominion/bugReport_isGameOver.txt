Is it reproducible: Yes always 

Description
===========
The isGameOver function is intended to determine if the game should be ceased. 
It does this by checking two conditions:
1) If no Province cards i the supply the game is over. 
OR 
2) If the supply count of any other three cards is empty the game is over.
If sea_hag and/or treasure_map are set to zero they are not counted and the result 
is incorrect provided there are the appropriate count of empty cards elsewhere in 
the supply.


Steps to Produce/Reproduce
--------------------------
1) Run the initializeGame function 
2) Set cards salvager, sea_hag and treasure_map to 0 in the supply. 
3) Run isGameOver with the gameState 


Expected Results
----------------
1


Actual Results
--------------
0


Workarounds
-----------
Change the 25 to 27 and the code works:

	for (i = 0; i < 25; i++)
	{
		if (state->supplyCount[i] == 0)
		{
			j++;
		}
	}
		if ( j >= 3)
		{
			return 1;
		}
		return 0;
	}


Attachments
-----------
Attached test case file unittest3.c can be used in conjuction with attached makefile.
In order to run the test use "make unittest3_Hw5" and the results will be printed to 
stdout.
