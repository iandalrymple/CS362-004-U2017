// Desc: 			Random test for fVillage function in dominion.c
// Author: 			Ian Dalrymple
// Date Created: 	07/21/2017
// HW4 -> CS362
// Requirements:
// 1 - gain two actions 
// 2 - gain a card from deck 
// 3 - gain a card to hand
// 4 - do not mutate any other players or any other features of the active player
// 5 - get rid of the village card to discard pile
