// Desc: 			Unit test for mine via cardEffect function in dominion.c
// Author: 			Ian Dalrymple
// Date Created: 	07/29/2017
// Requirements:
// 1 - only trash copper silver or gold 
// 2 - new card must be a valid card from enum
// 3 - cost of new card must be 3 or less in value than the one being trashed 
// 4 - discard the mine and the card you are replacing 
// 5 - no other players or other attributes in state should be mutated
