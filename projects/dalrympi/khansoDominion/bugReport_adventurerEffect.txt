Description
===========
The adventurerEffect function is intended to draw 
cards from the deck until two treasures are drawn. 
The cards that were drawn and are not treasures 
should then be placed in the discard pile. In this case 
three treasures are drawn.  This bug happens every run. 


Steps to Produce/Reproduce
--------------------------
1) Run the initializeGame function 
2) Ensure the deck has 20 cards and 5 treasures 
3) Run adventurerEffect with the gameState
4) Count the treasure increase in hand and/or total hand increase

Expected Results
----------------
Hand increase by 2
Discard increase by x - 2
Deck increase by x

Actual Results
--------------
Hand increase by 3
Discard increase by x - 3
Deck increase by x 

Workarounds
-----------
Change the <= to < and the code works:

	while(drawntreasure <= 2)
	{
		if (state->deckCount[currentPlayer] <1) //if the deck is empty we need to shuffle discard and add to deck
		{
			shuffle(currentPlayer, state);
		}
		drawCard(currentPlayer, state);
		cardDrawn = state->hand[currentPlayer][state->handCount[currentPlayer]-1];//top card of hand is most recently drawn card.
		if (cardDrawn == copper || cardDrawn == silver || cardDrawn == gold)
			drawntreasure++;
		else
		{
			temphand[z]=cardDrawn;
			state->handCount[currentPlayer]--; //this should just remove the top card (the most recently drawn one).
			// z++;
		}
	}

Attachments
-----------
Attached test case file cardtest2.c and randomtestadventurer.c can be used in conjuction with attached makefile.
In order to run the tests use "make cardtest2_Hw5" or "make randomtestadventurer_Hw5" and the results will be printed to 
stdout or .out file.

Other Information
-----------------
The commented out z++; is also suspect and likely causes other issues with one of the other 
counts like discardCount and should be investigated. A new bug report may need to be 
generated.
