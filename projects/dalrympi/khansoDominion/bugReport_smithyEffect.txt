Description
===========
The smithyEffect function is intended to draw three cards and then 
discard the Smithy using the position passed in to the function.
In this case 4 cards are drawn so the player's handcount increases 
by one too many and the deckcount decreases by one too many.


Steps to Produce/Reproduce
--------------------------
1) Run the initializeGame function 
2) Plant a Smithy in the users hand
3) Ensure the deck has 20 cards
4) Run smithyEffect with the gameState
5) Count the decks 

Expected Results
----------------
Deck decrease by 3 
Hand increase by 2
Discard increase by 1

Actual Results
--------------
Deck decrease by 4
Hand increase by 3
Discard increase by 1

Workarounds
-----------
Change the <= to < and the code works:

  for (i = 0; i <= 3; i++)
  {
    drawCard(currentPlayer, state);
  }

Attachments
-----------
Attached test case file cardtest1.c and randomcardtest2.c can be used in conjuction with attached makefile.
In order to run the tests use "make cardtest1_Hw5" or "make randomcardtest2_Hw5" and the results will be printed to 
stdout or .out file.

Other Information
